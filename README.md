##### Overview: 
Here we have explored and implemented different ways to
develop collaborative and latent-factor based Recommendation System.
1. [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) Dataset was used for this.
2. u1.base was used as Train data and u1.test was used as Test data.
3. For convenience UtilitiMatrix(Where each element U[u,i] represents rating given
by u user to i movie) was saved as a Scipy sparse matrix “UtilityMatrix.npz” and
used throughout.
